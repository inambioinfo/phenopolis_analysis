# commonly used data stored in offline_analysis/db
# tigerm data served from genenetwork, on RNA expression on retina. 
# Database Name: TIGEM_Human_Retina_RNA-Seq_Sep16_RPKM_log2
# GeneNetwork Accession Number: GN802
# For more information regarding this data set please visit: http://www.genenetwork.org/webqtl/main.py?FormID=sharinginfo&GN_AccessionId=802
#
# Z-Score.
# In general, the array data that we enter in GeneNetwork have been log transformed and then z-score normalized, but instead of leaving the mean at 0 and the standard deviation of 1 unit,
# the data is rescaled to a mean of 8 units with a standard deviation of 2 units (what we call 2Z + 8 normalized data).

Should do some stats to determine the best cutoffs.

# how often you would like to re-search on pubmed for new result
